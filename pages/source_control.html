        <p> Now that Visual Studio and Unity are properly set up, and now that you have
            gotten the chance to hopefully learn and explore the wonders of Unity, we are now ready
            to contribute to group projects through the concept of 'version control'. Version control helps
            all members of the club to edit, create, and contribute to the same project (code base/repository)
            remotely from our local machines. Any edits or changes can be pushed to the project for everyone
            else to use and contribute to as well.

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Downloading GIT</h3>
                <p>In order to employ the idea of version control, we will use a popular tool
                    known as Git. Git is an incredibly powerful, open source version control system that
                    keeps track of repositories/projects, the changes team members make to them, and orchestrates
                    everything for us behind the scenes. Since Git doesn't come with a GUI out of the box,
                    meaning it is typically dealt with in the terminal, we will need to download a GUI so we
                    can easily interact with Git. For now, we can download Git and not worry about the terminal.

                <p>Github.com is an online version control system, where students, developers,
                    and programmers in general can store their school, personal, or club projects.
                    Users can create 'repositories', and other users can contribute to these projects,
                    or copy them to their local machine and mess with them themselves. We can think of Github
                    as the social media for coding and projects. For all of our projects in this club, we will
                    create repositories on Github.com so that each member of the club can access them. Click the image
                    or the button to create an account and get started.

                <p>Now that we have Git installed, as well as a Github account created, we can now focus
                    on obtaining a GUI for Git, so that we do not need to use a terminal to manage our repositories.
                    Github Desktop will make 'cloning' our club repositorires as easy as a click, and will manage every
                    change, branch creation, and everything else, in one simple window. Go ahead and download it now!

                    Before we can start editing repositories and pushing our changes, we must configure Git (which we

                    with your Github account. Click the image or button for more information on how to configure the

                <p>With all of the boring downloads and configurations out of the way, we should
                    hopefully be ready to add a repository and make changes to it. To do this, we need the repository
                    URL from Github so that we can download it on our local machine through Github Desktop. Navigate to
                    the repository
                    you'd like to clone, and get the URL from here! If you've already been added as a contributor to the porject, 
                    don't worry about grabbing the URL.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Upon opening Github Desktop, you'll be prompted to log in and authorize your identity to Github.com.
                    After completing this step, you'll offered multiple options on how you can clone a repository. For this example,
                    we will clone a repository that is being hosted on Github, so choose the option "Clone a Repository from the Internet", as shown in the image.

                    here and choose to clone them this way. This removes the need of having a URL to the repository. Simply choose
                    the proper project, choose the local directory to save it to, and press clone.

                   If you find yourself needing to clone a repository from the URL we obtained before, simply switch to the 
                   URL tab, enter the URL of the repository, choose your directory location to save to, and hit clone.
